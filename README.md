This repository has been created to store content and code for [Giuliana Bezerra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulianabezerra/)'s [Automated tests with Spring Boot](https://www.udemy.com/course/testes-automatizados-na-pratica-com-spring-boot/) course. I've decided to take it so that I could deepen my testing knowledge in Java and improve my portfolio and CV.

During the course, the following frameworks and libraries were used:
- Spring Boot Test
- Junit 5
- Mockito
- AssertJ
- Hamcrest
- JsonPath
- Jacoco
- Pitest
- Apache Commons

I made some small changes to the original project, such as using a MySQL database with Docker instead of a local instance.
