This repository has been created to store content and code for [Giuliana Bezerra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulianabezerra/)'s [Automated tests with Spring Boot](https://www.udemy.com/course/testes-automatizados-na-pratica-com-spring-boot/) course.

During the course, the following frameworks and libraries are going to be used:
- Spring Boot Test
- Junit 5
- Mockito
- AssertJ
- Hamcrest
- JsonPath
- Jacoco
- Pitest
